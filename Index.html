            <h1> About Antonio</h1>
            <p>
                I was born on December 16<sup>th</sup> ,1991, in Cleveland,Ohio. I have lived in Ohio for all of my life and would
                want nothing more leave this state on the next thing smoking.
            </p> <p>
                I am an avid sports fan but football will always have my heart.
                My favorite pro team would have to be the Dallas Cowboys. I look forward to seeing Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott progressing in their very young careers.

            <h1>My pride and joy</h1>
            <p>
                My girlfriend Brandee and I have been together for 3 and half years. We met through a mutual friend and
                fireworks have not stopped! We have 1 baby girl named Janet who can only be described as my headache.
            </p>

            <p>Reasons why I call her my headache</p>
            <ul>
                <li>She loves playing on Daddy's iphone</li>
                <li>She is apparently allergic to a clean house</li>
                <li>
                    Any and all food must be placed on the floor
                    <ul>
                        <li>and on the wall</li>
                        <li>and in her hair</li>
                        <li>and on the dog...you get the idea</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>she has a love for ripping papers that daddy carelessly lays around the house</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What I hope to accomplish</h1>
            <p>
                I would like to provide for my family on a cosistent basis. For as long as I can remember one of my worst fears is lack of job security.
                I also would love to actually work for a company who values me and my opinions,
                and does not see me as just another face that makes them money.
                The tech field is a growing one and to finally become apart of it would be a dream come true.
